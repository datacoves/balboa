Open the current dbt model SQL file.

Run the dbt model from the directory containing dbt_project.yml using:
dbt run --select <model_name>

In your data Snowflake warehouse locate the relation created by the model in the correct schema and retrieve the list of columns.
Also get a count of the number of columns.
You should be using the _DEV database

Replace any * in the SQL with the explicit list of columns from the relation.
Count the number of columns and compare to the number of columns in Snowflake.

Follow the sqlfluff linting rules as defined

Ask me if I want to change the column order to alphabetical. If I say yes, do this:
Order the columns as follows:
First: all columns ending with _id (alphabetically)
Middle: all other columns (alphabetically)
Last: Date/Timestamp columns like create_date, create_time, update_date, update_time, etc. (alphabetically)
If I say no, keep the columns in the order as defined in the database.

Create or update the corresponding YAML file for the model, including:
A one-line description for the model
A one-line description for each column

Run the dbt model again to make sure it runs properly.
