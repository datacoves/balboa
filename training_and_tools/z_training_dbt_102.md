# Starschema Covid 19
This data comes from the Snowflake Data Marketplace

This data can be used as a single source of truth regarding the coronavirus outbreak, assess contingency plans and make informed, data-driven decisions in view of the global health emergency. In addition, various other data sources are included that bear on the handling of the pandemic, such as healthcare resource availability, demographics and testing data. Vaccination information, as well as data on the load on the healthcare system, can assist businesses and individuals in monitoring the progress of the pandemic.

More information can be found <a href="https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZSNZ7F5UH" target="_blank">here</a>

## Demo - Project layout
- Describe project folder layout:
    - automate, load, schedule, transform, etc
    - transform/models/bays, coves, sources etc
- Walk through models:
    - models/sources/starschema_covid19/jhu_covid_19:  
        Johns Hopkins raw COVID data
        - Source at starschema_covid19.public.jhu_covid_19  
            Data source: starschema public Snowflake share - we just imported it to the database  
            https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZSNZ7F5UH
        - Base will be built at balboa_dev.(dev schema).jhu_covid_19
    - models/bays/bay_covid/covid_location:
        Location data from jhu_covid_19  
        GPS coordinates change over time in the raw data as it gets more accurate  
        This model provides a single source of truth for geocoding - location "master data".  
        - Will be built at balboa_dev.(dev schema).covid_location
    - models/bays/bay_covid/covid_cases
        Pivoted from Johns Hopkins data  
        Allows summarizing / comparing individual fields
        - Will be built at balboa_dev.(dev schema).covid_cases
    - models/coves/cove_covid/covid_cases_country, covid_cases_state, covid_cases_county
        Separated various geographic granularities, as county figures are duplicated as a sum in state, and states in country.
        These should never be queried together, so are separated to different models.

- Open dbt docs
    - Show searching for 'John Hopkins' in dbt docs and in vscode to easily find models by metadata
    - Write descriptions for searchability, not just usage
    - Describe the importance of discoverability - discovering by database location, or by folder



## Demo - Exposures
- Create file in the exposures folder named `covid_prediction.yml`

```yml
version: 2

exposures:
  - name: covid_infections_prediction
    # dashboard, notebook, analysis, ml, application
    type: ml
    maturity: medium
    url: https://datacoves.com/covid_predictions
    description: >
      Predicts the number of Covid-19 cases by country for a future weeks
    
    depends_on:
      - ref('covid_location')
      - source('starschema_covid19', 'jhu_covid_19')
      
    owner:
      name: Santiago Pelufo
      email: santiago@datacoves.com
``` 
- build dbt docs
`dbt docs generate`
- Show the exposure
- change ml to `notebook`
- build dbt docs
`dbt docs generate`

## Demo - Packages
- Visit dbt hub `https://hub.getdbt.com`
- Talk about different types of packages, utils vs transformations
- visit the Snowplow package
- View the model snowplow/models/page_views/default/snowplow_web_page_context
https://github.com/dbt-labs/snowplow/blob/0.14.0/models/page_views/default/snowplow_web_page_context.sql

- Demonstrate dbt-external-tables
    - in snwoflake we have files on S3, not in snowflake
        `select * from balboa.information_schema.stages`
        `list @balboa.public.lineage_data`
    - We use package dbt-external-tables that creates a view over the external files
    - View the yml `models/sources/lineage/lineage_files.yml`
    - Run `dbt run-operation stage_external_sources --args "select: lineage" --vars "ext_full_refresh: true"`
    - In Snowflake, show `select * from raw.raw.lineage_processing;`
    - when new cols show up in source, VALUES get automatically updated, and yml needs to be updated to map the new col


## Demo - Snapshots
- We've been advised that Johns Hopkins will stop maintaining the jhu_covid_19 dataset, and will only be maintaining the 'dashboard' dataset going forward.  
    This dataset shows the current information, rather than storing historical results.  
    We need to store historical information ourselves.
- Show `select * from starschema_covid19.public.jhu_dashboard_covid_19_global;`
- Discuss pros/cons of using an incremental table for this use case
    - incremental would not store previous values if data was updated to a more accurate value after the fact
    - Snapshot will keep every version of truth
- Show snapshot at snapshots/snp_jhu_dashboard_covid_19_global.sql
    - Discuss unique key, timestamp field
    - Make a subfolder of snapshots `starschema_covid19` and move snapshot, to align with best practise
    - Run `dbt snapshot` and show in Snowflake in raw.snapshots.snp_jhu_dashboard_covid_19_global
    - In Snowflake, discuss dbt_* fields
    - To use a snapshot, select `where dbt_valid_to is null`
- Discuss how snapshot can create the same output as jhu_covid_19, but only if it had been created at the start
    - can't recreate historical data from master data, so start snapshotting early
    - can't recreate missed versions of data, so snapshot frequently
- Discuss snapshotting models as well as sources - need to use `dbt build` to do so, so they are included in the DAG

## Demo - Selectors
- Run each, showing what is selected:
    - `dbt ls --select int_covid_cases`
    - Use button `run current` to run the above - describe the helpfulness of automations
    - `dbt ls --select coves.cove_covid.agg` lists all models in folder
    - `dbt ls --resource-type source` limits to a specific type
    - `dbt ls --select source:balboa.starschema_covid19.jhu_covid_19+`
    - `dbt ls --select source:balboa.starschema_covid19.jhu_covid_19+ --resource-type exposure` will show the exposure we created earlier
    - `dbt ls --select source:balboa.starschema_covid19.jhu_covid_19+,balboa.bays` shows only bays downstream
    - `dbt ls --select source:balboa.starschema_covid19.jhu_covid_19+1`
    - `dbt ls --select +int_covid_cases+ --exclude covid_cases_county`
    - `dbt ls --select @int_covid_cases` (includes upstream, downstream, and covid_location, as parent of a child)
        - No need to use @ if we can defer

## Demo - Deferral
- Edit `models/bays/bay_covid/covid_location` to add the statement `where province_state ilike '%princess%'` to remove the cruise ships (setting up for state:modified)
- Run `dbt run-operation empty_dev_schema --args '{dry_run: false}'` to empty dev schema (we'll look at macro later)
- Show in Snowflake the `balboa_dev.gomezn` schema with data in it
- Use button `get prod metadata`, then run `dbt build --defer --select state:modified+`
        
- Discuss buttons `prod metadata` + `build changes` - this should run almost everything needed while developing
    - Discuss small stories and continuous release to align with the above


## Demo - Modelling best practice
- Open coves/covid_cases_country, show difference with covid_cases_state
- Generate an intermediate view coves/cove_covid/int/int_covid_cases
    - Copy logic from covid_cases_county
    - Remove the where statement
- Point covid_cases_country, state, county to new intermediate
```
select *
from {{ ref('int_covid_cases') }}
(original where statement)
```
- General cleanup of DRYness in cove
- Move config to dbt_project from config blocks in cove_covid/agg models

## Demo - Macros
- Show usage of `generate_imports` macro in `models/coves/cove_covid/agg/agg_cases_by_month.sql`
    - Show code of `macros/generate_imports`
    - Add `generate_imports` macro to new int_covid_cases model created above, to replace CTEs
- Create new rank macro
    - Open `bay_covid/covid_location.sql`,` bay_country/current_population.yml` to show repeated use of rank logic
    - Copy rank statement from covid_location
    - Open macros/rank_desc.sql, show basic macro framework
    - Paste rank statement, and replace partition `location_id` with `{{ partition_fields }}` and `date` with `{{ datefield }}`
    - Discuss documentation of macros, importance of usage
        - Create `macros/rank_desc.yml` and document the rank_desc model (reference `macros/generate_imports.yml` for syntax)
        - Show documentation of new macro in docs
    - Reopen `bay_covid/covid_location.sql` and replace inline rank with new macro
- Demonstrate `if statement`, `for loops`, and `set` statements
    - Show logging in Macro `empty_dev_schema`
    - Run `dbt run-operation empty_dev_schema` to demonstrate

- Demonstrate debugging with better logging
    - Create new macro `helpers/log_info.sql`

```
{# 
    This macro can be used to print a log message starting with a timestamp
    dbt run-operation log_info --args '{message: "test message"}'
 #}

{% macro log_info(message) %}
    {{ log(dbt_utils.pretty_log_format(message), true) }}
{% endmacro %}
```

- Replace log rows in `empty_dev_schema` with `{{ log_info(message) }}`
- Run `dbt run-operation empty_dev_schema` to demonstrate

## Performance Analysis
- Run in Snowflake 
```
select name,node_id, total_node_runtime as runtime_seconds 
from balboa.dbt_artifacts.fct_dbt__latest_full_model_executions
order by runtime_seconds desc;
```

- Discuss model runtime, and how it might be optimized

## Testing
- Show yml at models/sources/starschema_covid19/jhu_dashboard_covid_19_global.yml
    - Contains freshness tests:
        - Check data is fresh by running `dbt source freshness`
        - Adjust warn_after to 24 hours
        - Run `dbt source freshness`

- Custom test for expected pre-existing values
    - Show `covid_cases.yml` test
    - Show `data/test_values/covid_cases_expected_values`
    - Show custom test macro `macros/tests/check_critical_rows_exist_in_seed`
